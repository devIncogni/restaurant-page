                        At Code & Coffee, we understand that behind every line of great code is an even greater cup of
                        coffee. Built by developers, for developers, our café is more than just a place to grab a drink
                        -
                        it's a sanctuary where ideas brew as smoothly as our espresso.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From all-nighters to debugging marathons, we know the grind. That's why we craft every cup to
                        keep
                        you powered through every sprint, commit, and deployment. Our beans are sourced from the finest
                        farms and roasted to perfection - because developers deserve more than just instant coffee.
